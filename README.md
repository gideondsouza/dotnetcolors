# dotnetcolors

A handy app that displays all 141 .NET colours neatly.
## Origins 
While writing C# often I had to look out for what the .NET Colours from the Colour structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.color(v=vs.110).aspx) like [Color.MistyRose](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.colors.mistyrose(v=vs.110).aspx and [ColorAzure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.media.colors.azure(v=vs.110).aspx) looked like visually.So I wrote this little utility in 2007 or so.

The C# community on usenet, yes [usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) liked it. I got suggestions and help and tuned the app into **Colours 2** which is the name you'll see in the source.  ,

## Features:
* the boxes arrange themselves to fill the window as it is resized.

* Clicking the colour box , highlights( thcopies the hex code to the clipboard.
