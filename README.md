# dotnetcolors
A simple little application that displays all 141 .NET colours neatly. 

This is a little program I made many years ago. I always had to look out for what the .NET Colours like MistyRose and Azure looked like and made this little reference app. Clicking the colour box copies the hex code to the clipboard.

What is interesting is how the boxes arrange themselves to fill the window as it is resized.
