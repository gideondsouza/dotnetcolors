# dotnetcolors

A handy app that displays all 141 .NET colours neatly.

## Origins 
While writing C# often I had to figure out tediously what the .NET Colours from the [Colour structure][2] Eg.[Color.MistyRose][1] and [Color.Azure][3].looked like visually.So I wrote this little utility in 2007 or so.

The C# community on usenet, yes [usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) liked it. I got suggestions and help and tuned the app into **Colours 2** which is the name you'll see in the source.  ,

## Features:
* The boxes arrange themselves to fill the window as it is resized.

* Clicking the colour box , highlights( thcopies the hex code to the clipboard.
